  <h1>About PlaySkyDrift</h1>
  <p>PlaySkyDrift is a small project focused on fast, mobile‑friendly browser games that work without downloads or logins. We design and tune our games to start instantly, play smoothly on mid‑range devices, and respect your time with clear controls and no clutter.</p>
  <p>Our flagship title, Sky Drift, is a lightweight HTML5 platformer. We update the game regularly based on player feedback, improve performance on low‑end phones, and publish guides and tips to help players reach higher scores.</p>
  <p>We value transparency and safety. Our site includes a privacy policy, terms of use, and clear contact options. We also keep ad placements conservative and away from gameplay controls to maintain a clean experience.</p>
  <p>If you have requests, bug reports, or collaboration ideas, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
